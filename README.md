(define-public (deposit (amount uint))
  (begin
    (var-set total-saved (+ (var-get total-saved) amount))
    (ok true)
  )
)

(define-public (stake-for-yield (vault-id uint) (amount uint) (strategy (string-ascii 20)))
  (let ((yield-amount (calculate-yield amount strategy)))
    (ok (var-set total-saved (+ (var-get total-saved) yield-amount)))
  )
)
